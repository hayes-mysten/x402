# Scheme: `exact` on `Sui`

## Summary

The `exact` scheme on Sui transfers a specific `amount` of an asset from the payer to the resource
server's recipient, `payTo`. The payer builds and signs a complete Sui transaction, so the
facilitator cannot change the amount or the destination. The facilitator broadcasts the payer-signed
bytes and, when it sponsors gas, co-signs as the gas owner.

Verification is effects-only: it checks only the outcome, that the transaction's balance changes
credit `payTo` with exactly `amount`, not how the transaction is built. A payment can draw the asset
from an address balance, `Coin<T>` objects, a swap, a contract withdrawal, or any mix. With
[splits](#splits), the same check covers each recipient's share.

## Terminology

- **Address balance**: A per-address, per-coin-type balance held by the protocol, not in a coin
  object.
- **Coin reservation**: An input or gas-payment entry that reserves part of an address balance.
- **Gas owner**: The address that pays for gas and signs for it; the sender unless sponsored.
- **`GasCoin`**: The argument for the gas coin; with an empty gas payment, a coin equal to the
  budget.
- **`Pure` input**: A transaction input of raw bytes; it is unused when no command references it.

## Asset Transfer Method

Sui has one method, in the facilitator-submitted family of [`exact`](./scheme_exact.md#asset-transfer-method-families):

- **Fee payer**: the payer, or the facilitator when it sponsors gas. A gasless transfer pays no fee.
  See [Gas](#gas).
- **Replay primitive**: the transaction digest, which is exclusive to the payment. The chain
  executes a transaction at most once. The funds are not reserved, though. If the payer spends the
  same balance or coins elsewhere after verify, settle fails even though the resource handler has
  already run.
- **Validity window**: bounded by the required [expiration](#expiration), at most two epochs (about
  48 hours on mainnet).
- **Duplicate submission**: indistinguishable. Re-submitting an executed transaction returns its
  original effects as a success, so the facilitator deduplicates by digest (see
  [Settlement deduplication](#settlement-deduplication)).

## Protocol Sequencing

1. Client requests a resource and receives a `402 Payment Required` response with the
   `PaymentRequirements`.
2. Client queries a Sui RPC for the current epoch and any balance or gas data it needs.
3. Client builds a transaction that credits `payTo`, and each split recipient, with its share of
   `amount` and arranges gas (see [Gas](#gas)).
4. Client signs the transaction and resends the request with the `PaymentPayload`.
5. Resource server asks the facilitator to verify the payload.
6. Resource server fulfills the request.
7. Resource server asks the facilitator to settle. On a sponsored payment the facilitator co-signs
   the client-signed bytes as gas owner.
8. Facilitator submits the transaction, waits for finality, and reports the result.
9. Resource server returns the response to the client.

This is the `authorization` payment flow, and it is the default. Sui also supports `upfront`, where
the resource server settles before step 6. Finality is sub-second, so `upfront` costs little, and a
resource server MAY use it when the work is costly.

## Network Format

x402 v2 uses CAIP-2 network identifiers:

- **Mainnet:** `sui:mainnet`
- **Testnet:** `sui:testnet`
- **Devnet:** `sui:devnet`

## `PaymentRequirements` for `exact`

```json
{
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "sui:mainnet",
  "amount": "10000",
  "asset": "0xdba34672e30cb065b1f93e3ab55318768fd6fef66c15942c9f7cb846e2f900e7::usdc::USDC",
  "payTo": "0x1eb7c57e3f2bd0fc6cb9dcffd143ea957e4d98f805c358733f76dee0667fe0b1",
  "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
  "extra": {}
}
```

- `asset`: The coin type `T`, as a normalized Sui struct tag.
- `payTo`: The recipient address.
- `amount`: The exact total the payer pays, in atomic units, as a positive decimal string. With
  splits, `payTo` receives the remainder. A resource server refuses to build requirements with any
  other amount.
- `extra.feePayer` (optional): The facilitator's sponsor address. The facilitator advertises it in
  `/supported` and the resource server copies it into the requirements. See
  [Gas sponsorship](#gas-sponsorship).
- `extra.maxGasBudget` (optional): The largest gas budget the sponsor accepts, in MIST, as a decimal
  string. Present whenever `extra.feePayer` is. A client using the sponsor MUST NOT exceed it.
- `extra.nonce` (optional): A Base64-encoded, server-issued value that binds the payment to its
  challenge. See [Server-issued nonce](#server-issued-nonce).
- `extra.splits` (optional): Additional recipients that share `amount`. See [Splits](#splits).

A resource server MUST NOT put the epoch or other build hints in `extra`: the server compares the
client's `accepted.extra` to its own by value, and the epoch changes every 24 hours.

## PaymentPayload `payload` Field

- `transaction`: The Base64-encoded, BCS-serialized Sui transaction.
- `signature`: One Base64 Sui signature per required signer, as a string or an array. Required
  signers are the sender and, if different, the gas owner. When the gas owner is the facilitator's
  sponsor, omit its signature; the facilitator adds it at settlement.

```json
{
  "transaction": "AAAA...AAAA=",
  "signature": "AbCd...=="
}
```

  }
}
```

## Construction

The client builds one Sui transaction whose effects credit `payTo` with exactly `amount` of `asset`,
or, with [splits](#splits), each recipient with exactly its share. Because verification is
effects-only, the asset source is unconstrained. `tx.balance({ type, balance })` in the Sui SDK
picks the source (address balance or coins) automatically.

### Expiration

Sui requires a bounded expiration on any transaction with no address-owned inputs, no coin
reservations, and no gas payment. Validators remember executed digests for the current and previous
epoch, so such a transaction executes at most once. Owned-object transactions are protected by
object versions instead; this scheme requires the expiration on every payment so that all payments
have the same bounded window.

The client MUST set a `ValidDuring` or `Validity` expiration with both `minEpoch` and `maxEpoch` set
and `maxEpoch - minEpoch <= 1`. It SHOULD set `minEpoch` to the current epoch and `maxEpoch` to the
current epoch plus one. It MUST NOT set `minTimestamp` or `maxTimestamp`, because validators
currently reject timestamp-based expiration.

The validity window is therefore epoch-granular: up to about 48 hours on mainnet, where an epoch is
24 hours. `maxTimeoutSeconds` is advisory because Sui cannot enforce it. Once Sui supports timestamp
expiration, clients SHOULD bound the transaction by `maxTimeoutSeconds`.

### Server-issued nonce

`extra.nonce` is a Base64-encoded value that the resource server issues per challenge. The client
MUST add a `Pure` input whose bytes equal the decoded nonce exactly (raw bytes, not BCS-encoded). A
client that wants its Move commands to read the nonce adds a separate BCS `vector<u8>` input.

The resource server MUST return the same value each time it rebuilds the requirements for the same
challenge, because requirement matching compares `extra` by value. It can store the value or derive
it statelessly, for example as an HMAC over the challenge.

The nonce binds a payment to its challenge and can serve as an invoice or order reference. It is not
consumed on-chain, and [settlement deduplication](#settlement-deduplication) is keyed on the
transaction digest, not the nonce. A server that wants at most one payment per challenge retires the
challenge itself once it has served it.

A nonce longer than 32 bytes makes the payment ineligible for [gasless](#gasless-transfers)
execution.

### Gas

When the requirements include `extra.feePayer`, a client SHOULD use the facilitator's sponsor (the
address in `extra.feePayer`), and MAY instead pay its own gas. Otherwise it MAY build a
[gasless transfer](#gasless-transfers) when eligible, or make a self-paid payment (the sender is the
gas owner). A client MAY also use its own sponsor and include that sponsor's signature in the
payload.

#### Gas sponsorship

To use the facilitator's sponsor, the client builds the transaction with:

1. `sender` set to the payer.
2. Gas owner set to the facilitator's sponsor.
3. Gas payment set explicitly to `[]` (MUST), so gas is reserved from the sponsor's SUI address
   balance.
4. A gas budget no larger than `extra.maxGasBudget`.
5. No command that uses `GasCoin`. A client using `tx.balance` or `tx.coin` for a SUI payment passes
   `useGasCoin: false`.

The client signs as sender. At settlement the facilitator co-signs the same bytes as gas owner and
executes with both signatures.

Whenever the gas owner is an address the facilitator sponsors for, whether or not the requirements
name it, the facilitator MUST check the following at verify and again at settle:

- The gas payment is empty. A non-empty payment names the sponsor's coin objects or coin
  reservations, which contend with concurrent payments, and a reservation can expose the sponsor's
  whole balance.
- The gas budget is at most the facilitator's configured cap, advertised as `extra.maxGasBudget`.
- No command argument references `GasCoin`, which would spend the sponsor's funds up to the budget.
- No funds withdrawal draws from the sponsor, either as `Sponsor` or as `SenderAllowance` with the
  sponsor as `funder`. Sui currently rejects `Sponsor` withdrawals; the check guards against that
  changing.

These checks apply only to sponsored payments. A self-paid payment may use `GasCoin`, and a gasless
transaction has no gas coin to use.

A sponsored transaction that fails for lack of funds is not charged gas. One that aborts during
execution costs the sponsor up to the signed budget, bounded by the cap and per-sender rate
limiting. The sponsor SHOULD rate-limit per sender and MAY apply other policy.

Earlier drafts of this spec used `extra.gasStation`; clients MUST ignore it.

#### Gasless transfers

Sui executes some stablecoin transfers with no gas. The
[Sui docs](https://docs.sui.io/develop/transaction-payment/gasless-stablecoin-transfers) define the
full rules. In summary, a gasless transfer:

- pays an allowlisted stablecoin (such as USDC) from the payer's address balance;
- on mainnet, credits each recipient at least 10,000 atomic units ($0.01 for USDC) and leaves the
  payer's address balance at 0 or at least that minimum;
- has every `Pure` input at most 32 bytes, with at most one unused;
- creates or mutates no objects, so an on-chain receipt object forfeits gasless.

With splits, the minimum applies to each recipient's share, the remainder included.

Gasless transactions are deprioritized under congestion. A gas-price-0 transaction that breaks a
rule is rejected, not charged.

## Splits

A resource server MAY split one payment between `payTo` and up to 8 other recipients. This binds the
[multi-payee splits extension](./scheme_exact.md#multi-payee-splits-optional-extension) to Sui. The
whole payment is one transaction, so every recipient is paid or none is.

### `extra.splits`

```json
{
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "sui:mainnet",
  "amount": "1050000",
  "asset": "0xdba34672e30cb065b1f93e3ab55318768fd6fef66c15942c9f7cb846e2f900e7::usdc::USDC",
  "payTo": "0x1eb7c57e3f2bd0fc6cb9dcffd143ea957e4d98f805c358733f76dee0667fe0b1",
  "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
  "extra": {
    "splits": [
      {
        "payTo": "0x369cf71b2f13b63c165c207bc3f263b1df9da754ca6a2d09300d9b4bf45f62f0",
        "amount": "50000",
        "memo": "platform fee"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The payer pays `1050000` in total: `50000` to the split recipient and the remaining `1000000` to
`payTo`.

- `splits[].payTo`: The recipient address.
- `splits[].amount`: The recipient's share in atomic units of `asset`, as an absolute amount.
- `splits[].memo` (optional): A label for the share, at most 566 bytes in UTF-8. It is not put on
  chain.

An absent or empty `splits` means a single-recipient payment.

### Requirements rules

- `splits` is an array of at most 8 entries, and no more than the facilitator advertises.
- Each entry is an object with `payTo`, `amount`, and optionally `memo`, and no other fields.
- Each `payTo` is a valid Sui address.
- Each `amount` is a positive decimal integer no greater than `2^64 - 1`, with no sign, decimal
  point, exponent, or leading zeros.
- `payTo` receives the remainder, `amount - Σ splits[].amount`, which MUST be greater than zero.
- All recipients, `payTo` included, MUST be distinct. Addresses are compared in normalized form
  (`0x` and 64 lowercase hex digits).

Requirements that break a rule are invalid (`invalid_payment_requirements`). There is no rounding. A
server that computes shares as percentages rounds them before it builds the requirements, and the
remainder to `payTo` absorbs the difference.

### Advertisement

A facilitator that accepts splits advertises `maxSplits`, an integer from 1 to 8, in the `extra` of
its `/supported` kind. Absent or 0 means it accepts no splits. A facilitator MUST reject
requirements whose `splits` has more entries than it accepts (`invalid_payment_requirements`). A
resource server MUST NOT build requirements that exceed what its facilitator advertises, and does
not copy `maxSplits` into the requirements. `maxSplits` does not depend on `feePayer`; a
facilitator that does not sponsor gas can still accept splits.

### Client

Before signing, the client MUST check that the split recipients, amounts, and memos are ones it
agreed to, and that the remainder is what reaches `payTo`. It shows a memo next to the address, not
in place of it. A client that cannot check them MUST NOT pay.

The client credits each recipient with its share. In the Sui SDK, one `0x2::balance::send_funds<T>`
per recipient does this, each funded by its own `tx.balance({ type, balance })`. A sponsored payment
passes `useGasCoin: false` to each. Sui allows at most 10 balance withdrawals in a transaction,
counting gas paid from an address balance, so this construction fits 9 recipients.

A split payment is eligible for [gasless](#gasless-transfers) execution only when every share,
including the remainder, meets the network minimum. A resource server that expects gasless clients
SHOULD keep every share at or above it.

### Effects with splits

The [effects check](#effects-check) runs once per recipient: `payTo` MUST net exactly the
remainder, and each split recipient exactly its `amount`. Because recipients are distinct and
balance changes are netted per address, each share is checked against its own balance change.

Netting has consequences for the server:

- A payment whose sender is a recipient cannot match.
- When `asset` is SUI, a payment whose gas owner is a recipient cannot match. A sponsor can be a
  split recipient, for example to recover its gas cost, only when `asset` is not SUI.

## Verification

The facilitator returns a `VerifyResponse` (core spec [§5.4](../../x402-specification-v2.md)) with
`payer` set to the transaction's `sender`. Steps 1-5 are the offline checks.

1. **Envelope.** `x402Version` MUST be `2` (`invalid_x402_version`). The scheme MUST be `"exact"`
   (`unsupported_scheme`). The payload network MUST match the requirements (`network_mismatch`) and
   be a supported Sui network (`invalid_network`). The payload MUST be `{ transaction, signature }`
   (`invalid_payload`), and the transaction bytes MUST decode
   (`invalid_exact_sui_payload_transaction_could_not_be_decoded`). The requirements' `amount` MUST
   be a positive integer, and a non-empty `extra.splits` MUST pass the
   [splits rules](#requirements-rules) (`invalid_payment_requirements`).
2. **Signatures.** The transaction MUST have a `sender`
   (`invalid_exact_sui_payload_missing_sender`). The payload MUST carry exactly one valid signature
   per required signer, as described in [`payload`](#paymentpayload-payload-field)
   (`invalid_exact_sui_payload_invalid_signature`).
3. **Nonce.** When the requirements declare `extra.nonce`, it MUST be valid Base64 and a `Pure`
   input MUST equal the decoded bytes (`invalid_exact_sui_payload_missing_nonce`).
4. **Expiration.** The transaction MUST carry a `ValidDuring` or `Validity`
   [expiration](#expiration) with both epochs set and a span of at most one
   (`invalid_exact_sui_payload_invalid_expiration`). This step checks only the variant, the epochs,
   and the span. Timestamps are not checked offline; simulation rejects them today.
5. **Sponsorship.** When the gas owner is an address the facilitator sponsors for, the transaction
   MUST pass the [sponsorship checks](#gas-sponsorship)
   (`invalid_exact_sui_payload_sponsorship_rejected`).
6. **Not already executed.** The facilitator recomputes the digest and looks it up. If the
   transaction has already executed, it rejects with `invalid_exact_sui_payload_already_executed`.
   This is needed because re-simulating an executed address-balance transaction still succeeds. The
   lookup is best-effort: a node that has not indexed or has pruned the transaction reports it as
   missing. See [deduplication](#settlement-deduplication).
7. **Simulate.** The facilitator simulates the signed transaction as-is, with transaction checks
   enabled and without letting the node select gas (`invalid_exact_sui_payload_simulation_failed`).
   This rejects an expired transaction.
8. **Effects.** The simulated `balanceChanges` MUST pass the [effects check](#effects-check).

Any other error during verification returns `invalid_exact_sui_payload_verification_error`.

### Effects check

A balance change is `{ coinType, address, amount }`. Sui nets balance changes per address and coin
type. For each recipient the facilitator sums its entries in `asset` (zero if there are none) and
requires the total to equal that recipient's share exactly
(`invalid_exact_sui_payload_transfer_mismatch` on a simulation, `settlement_effects_mismatch` on
executed effects). Without splits, the only recipient is `payTo` and its share is `amount`. With
splits, see [Effects with splits](#effects-with-splits). The facilitator does not check the payer's
debit or credits to other addresses. Because balance changes are net, a recipient that is also the
sender, or that is the gas owner when `asset` is SUI, cannot match.

The facilitator MUST request balance changes where the transport makes them opt-in. At verify it
MUST reject the payment when they are unavailable. At settle, if the execution result lacks balance
changes, it fetches the transaction by digest. If they are still missing, it returns
`transaction_failed`, not `settlement_effects_mismatch`.

## Settlement

1. Re-run the offline checks (verification steps 1-5), with the same reason codes. A signature check
   that fails for environmental reasons, such as a zkLogin RPC error, returns `transaction_failed`.
2. Check that the current epoch is within `[minEpoch, maxEpoch]`
   (`invalid_exact_sui_payload_invalid_expiration`). A fullnode returns the cached effects of an
   executed transaction without re-checking its expiration; without this check, a claim would have
   to be kept forever.
3. Claim the transaction digest. If it is already claimed, return `duplicate_settlement`.
4. Submit the transaction and wait for finality. On a self-paid or gasless payment the facilitator
   only relays the signed bytes. On a sponsored payment the sponsor co-signs and executes, or
   declines (`sponsor_rejected`).
5. Require a successful execution status (`transaction_failed`) and pass the
   [effects check](#effects-check) on the executed `balanceChanges` (`settlement_effects_mismatch`).

If submission or the finality wait fails, the facilitator SHOULD look the transaction up by digest
and report its actual outcome. If the lookup also fails, it releases the claim and returns
`transaction_failed` with the digest in `transaction`, so the resource server can reconcile.

On success the facilitator returns a `SettlementResponse` (core spec
[§5.3](../../x402-specification-v2.md)) with the digest as `transaction`, the `network`, and the
`payer`.

### Settlement deduplication

The chain executes a transaction at most once, but re-submitting an executed transaction returns its
original effects as a success. The facilitator MUST deduplicate settlements so that it reports
success at most once per transaction:

1. The claim key is the transaction digest, scoped by network.
2. The facilitator claims the key before submitting, and only after the offline checks pass, so a
   forged payload cannot hold a genuine payment's key.
3. Checking and recording the claim MUST be atomic with respect to concurrent settle requests.
4. The facilitator keeps the claim only when settlement succeeds and releases it on any other
   outcome. Releasing on failure is safe: if the transaction executed and failed, re-submitting it
   returns the same failure, so a retry cannot turn it into a success.
5. A successful claim MUST be kept until at least one epoch after `maxEpoch` has ended. A node that
   lags by an epoch would otherwise accept a re-settle of an evicted claim.
6. When several processes serve `/settle`, they MUST share one claim store. A single process MAY
   keep claims in memory. After a restart, the only protection against re-settling a payment the
   store has forgotten is verify's best-effort [digest lookup](#verification), which the standard
   resource server flow always runs first. A facilitator whose settle can be called without verify
   SHOULD use a durable claim store. Two facilitators that do not share a claim store can each
   report the same payment as settled.
7. `duplicate_settlement` therefore means the payment has already settled successfully or a settle
   for it is in progress.

## Security Considerations

- **Authorization scope.** The payer signs the complete transaction, so no other party can redirect
  the payment or reduce the recipient's credit.
- **Atomicity.** A Sui programmable transaction is all-or-nothing, so the credit lands in full or
  not at all. With splits, every recipient is paid or none is.
- **Cross-network replay.** `ValidDuring` and `Validity` carry the chain identifier, so a payment
  signed for one network cannot execute on another.
- **Split consent.** The resource server chooses the split recipients. The client MUST check them
  before signing (see [Client](#client)).
- **Sponsor address.** The sponsor address SHOULD be dedicated to gas, with no roles or privileges
  elsewhere, since Move code can read `tx_context::sponsor()`.

Replay and repeat settlement are covered under [Expiration](#expiration) and
[Settlement deduplication](#settlement-deduplication); sponsor exposure under
[Gas sponsorship](#gas-sponsorship).
